#' Estimating ATE and Cross-Site Variation for Multisite (block) RCTs
#'
#' This code bundle is a package for estimating impacts and cross-site variation
#' in multi-site or blocked RCTs.
#'
#' It is the compainion package for Pashley & Miratrix (2020) and Miratrix,
#' Weiss & Henderson (2020).
#'
#' It also has a bunch of routines for running multisite simulation scenarios.
#' It is used in a variety of research projects connected with the Miratrix
#' CARES Lab (\url{https://cares.gse.harvard.edu/}) and other research that
#' Miratrix is part of.
#'
#' The github has development versions, with more experimental code. For working
#' (cleaner) versions see CRAN. See
#' \href{https://github.com/lmiratrix/blkvar#readme}{GitHub} for current
#' development version.

## quiets concerns of R CMD check re: the .'s that appear in pipelines (and .MULTISITE_CANONICAL is a true global variable).
