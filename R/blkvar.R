#' Estimating ATE and Cross-Site Variation for Multisite (block) RCTs
#'
#' This code bundle is a package for estimating impacts and cross-site variation
#' in multi-site or blocked RCTs.
#'
#' It is the companion package for three papers on blocking and multisite experiments (see references below).
#'
#'
#' It also has a bunch of routines for running multisite simulation scenarios.
#' It is used in a variety of research projects connected with the Miratrix
#' CARES Lab (\url{https://cares.gse.harvard.edu/}) and other research that
#' Miratrix is part of.
#'
#' While planned for posting on CRAN, the current version is currently hosted on GitHub. See
#' \href{https://github.com/lmiratrix/blkvar#readme}{GitHub} for current
#' development version.

## quiets concerns of R CMD check re: the .'s that appear in pipelines (and .MULTISITE_CANONICAL is a true global variable).
