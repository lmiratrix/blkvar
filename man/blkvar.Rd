Estimating ATE and Cross-Site Variation for Multisite (block) RCTs
}
\details{
This code bundle is a package for estimating impacts and cross-site variation
in multi-site or blocked RCTs.

It is the companion package for three papers on blocking and multisite experiments (see references below).


It also has a bunch of routines for running multisite simulation scenarios.
It is used in a variety of research projects connected with the Miratrix
CARES Lab (\url{https://cares.gse.harvard.edu/}) and other research that
Miratrix is part of.

While planned for posting on CRAN, the current version is currently hosted on GitHub. See
\href{https://github.com/lmiratrix/blkvar#readme}{GitHub} for current
development version.
