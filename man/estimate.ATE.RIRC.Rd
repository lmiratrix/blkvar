\title{Estimate the ATE using Random-Intercept, Random-Coefficient (RIRC) Models}
\usage{
estimate.ATE.RIRC(Yobs, Z, B, data = NULL, REML = FALSE,
  include.testing = TRUE, pool = FALSE)

estimate.ATE.RICC(Yobs, Z, B, data = NULL, REML = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{Name of the block indicator.}

\item{pool}{TRUE means tx and co have same reBual variance. FALSE gives seperate estimates for each (recommended, default).}
}
\description{
This model has a single treatment coefficient, and a random intercept for the
site control average. So it is analogous to a fixed effect model, but with a
random effect.
}
\details{
There is no test for cross site variation for this method, since we assume none.
