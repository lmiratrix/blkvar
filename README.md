# The blkvar package
This code bundle is a package for estimating impacts and cross-site variation in multi-site or blocked RCTs.
It also has a bunch of routines for running multisite simulation scenarios.
It is used in a variety of research projects connected with the Miratrix CARES Lab (https://cares.gse.harvard.edu/) and other research that Miratrix is part of.
For working versions see CRAN.
