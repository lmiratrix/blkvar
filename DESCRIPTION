Description: This package contains code for four primary
    purposes: (1) estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) in
    block-randomized experiments, even those with singleton treated or
    control units, (2) estimating ATEs for multisite trials, (3)
    estimating cross-site variation in site-level ATEs using a variety of
    methods, and (4) providing code for conducting simulations of blocked
    or multisite randomized trials.  There is also some additional code
    implementing power calculation functions for these contexts. See
    Pashley & Miratrix, 2020 <arXiv:1710.10342> for further details on
    (1).
