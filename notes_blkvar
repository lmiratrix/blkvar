NOTES:

1. Change all code according to the Google style VignetteBuilder
2. calc.RCT.Yes.SE - does that import from an exterior package or does it need
to be defined?
3. compare_methods_oracle - is this function used?
analysis_systematic.R & analysis_systematic.RTx.R


4. add.neyman, scaled.weights,  REML, calc.CI, sid (is this site ID?),
sigma2.W, variable.p, finite.model, size.ratio, block.stats, weight.LM.method,
weight.LM.scale.weights, 

  - not defined as argument in the package.

Functions that need new argumnts: describe_data,

5. No longer used: qstatistic_method.R, FIRC_method.R,
